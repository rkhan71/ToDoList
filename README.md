# ToDoList
I used the core principles of Object Oriented Programming with JavaFX to create a simple To-Do List application. The application allows users to create tasks with associated due dates and then remove them from the To-Do List when they have completed them. The application keeps track of the number of remaining and completed tasks and shows these tasks in a TableView object. The TableView object presents the tasks as objects of the static class Task as shown in the ToDoList.java file. This static class stores all attributes related to a task including its name, the type of task, the time it was created, when it is due, and when it was completed (once the task is completed).
